For this assignment, I worked with typography by creating designs for four different mediums: a book, a poster, a slide show and an Instagram post. For each medium, I created two versions: one with just text and one with images. I chose American designer Karim Rashid, who is known for his bright colors and funky shapes.

While designing the poster, I noticed that my first version was too busy and placed too much emphasis on minor elements. The pink pattern was too strong in the background so I adjusted my design. I provided more space around the text and gave the quote more prominence, while reducing the crowding by omitting some elements and adding more white space.

After several reworkings and printing to make the bright colors stand out, I was pleased with the result of both the posters and the book spreads. Reflecting on the assignment, I found it instructive and challenging to work with InDesign and to adapt each design to the specific medium. All in all, I am satisfied with my designs and the final result.
