For our scout camp that took place in July 2024, I designed the camp booklet. In doing so, I had to keep in mind the theme namely “Famous”. Our scouts name is Parsifal, therefore we chose the camp theme Parsifamous. I also had to take into account the contents of the camp booklet. For example, a number of things had to be sure to come in and it had to be clear to both the parents and the members who went along on camp. I really liked this assignment because it was for my own scouts and because I could do almost completely what I wanted. Below are all the pages in the camp booklet.
