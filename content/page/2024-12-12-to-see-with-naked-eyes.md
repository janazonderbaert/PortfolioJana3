For this assignment, I got to work with color. To begin with, I studied the color theory of Johannes Itten. By researching this, I learned more about the different color contrasts. I examined each color contrast and also learned more about Itten's color wheel. 

Furthermore, the idea was to start making photographic observations of colors in your environment. These photographs are the starting point to create color samples using paint. Ultimately, the goal was to create at least 10 color palettes to go with your 10 best photos. 

It was a very interesting assignment to be involved with. Both with the composition of the different colors and making good photos with different color contrasts. Here are a selection from my best photos from my area.
