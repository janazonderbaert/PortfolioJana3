::div{.ubuntu-light}

I recorded my culinary life through photographs and text. The goal was to use these visual and textual elements to tell a personal story about our eating experiences and habits. Each week I took photos of meals, snacks or special culinary moments, using a white PVC background to focus on the food itself. To add structure and depth to our project, we had to apply the LATCH principles: Location, Alphabet, Time, Category and Hierarchy. These principles helped us organize and give meaning to the photos and texts.

I decided to shape my final result in the form of a booklet, in which I collected my 30 best images, each accompanied by a text explaining the context and background of the dish. This made the booklet not only visually appealing, but also informative and meaningful. The cover of the booklet invites the reader to continue browsing, while each page shares a unique experience, such as the memory of a special family dinner or the recipe of my favorite dish. This assignment gave me the opportunity to capture and share my culinary experiences in a creative way.
