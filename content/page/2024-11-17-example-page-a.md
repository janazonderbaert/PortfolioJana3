::div{.ubuntu-light}

I designed a catalog for the exhibition “Undercrawlers, small animals in art and science” at the Rijksmuseum. I had the freedom to choose format, number of pages and fonts, with the condition that the number of pages should be a multiple of 4.

To begin with, I worked on the sketches and placement of text and images. In the end, I chose a 12x21 cm size, which I found aesthetically pleasing.

Then I began designing in InDesign. I worked on the cover with a dark background and a continuous image, and experimented with different fonts. 

After several print attempts to evaluate the layout, I adjusted my designs and decided to print the catalog on tinted paper, which was a better fit. Sewing the catalog went smoothly.

Reflecting on the process, I found the assignment challenging but educational. Finding the right format and font took time, but it made the next steps go more smoothly. I developed my skills in InDesign and found it motivating to see my progress from sketch to a finished catalog. In the end, I am satisfied with the final result and learned a lot during this assignment.
