Hello, I'm Jana Baert, 19 years old and a creative jack-of-all-trades with a passion for design and expression. In my daily life, I combine my studies with my hobbies and volunteer work.  

I am a student at LUCA School of Arts, where I am currently in my second bachelor Media and Information Design. Here I am learning how to bring stories and information to life in a visual and impactful way, and that fits perfectly with my love for creativity and design.  

In addition to my studies, I am also active as a leader in Scouts, where I guide children and organize unforgettable adventures. I also dance at a high level, which gives me the opportunity to express myself physically and artistically.  

Below you will find a selection of my works and photos that not only show my personal style and creativity, but also give an insight into who I am. Have fun!
